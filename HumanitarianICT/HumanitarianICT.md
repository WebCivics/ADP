1. Introduction

   Humanitarian Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is vital
   for supporting Human Rights Instruments and International Humanitarian
   Law. This document aims to provide a comprehensive framework for
   Humanitarian ICT, addressing the identification of Humanitarian ICT
   workers, websites, online services, and the use of tools such as 
   credentials for prioritization in challenging conditions.

2. Definitions

   2.1. Humanitarian ICT Worker

      A Humanitarian ICT worker is an individual involved in the design,
      implementation, or maintenance of Information and Communication
      Technology systems directly supporting humanitarian efforts. These
      professionals play a crucial role in ensuring the availability and
      functionality of ICT services in challenging environments.

      A Humanitarian ICT worker is defined as an individual engaged in 
      providing information and communication technology services to 
      support humanitarian activities. This includes professionals 
      responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of 
      ICT systems used in humanitarian aid delivery. To extend similar 
      considerations to other peace workers in 
      International Humanitarian Law (IHL), a Humanitarian ICT worker 
      is recognized as an essential actor in the protection and 
      well-being of affected populations during crises.

   2.2. Humanitarian ICT Services

      Humanitarian ICT services encompass a wide range of technologies
      and tools critical for the effective delivery of aid and protection
      in humanitarian contexts. These include communication channels,
      data management systems, emergency response technologies, and other
      services directly contributing to humanitarian objectives.

      Humanitarian ICT services encompass a wide range of technologies 
      and tools vital for the effective delivery of humanitarian aid, 
      protection, and assistance. These services include communication 
      channels, data management systems, logistics and coordination 
      tools, and other technologies directly contributing to humanitarian 
      activities. Recognizing the importance of personal infrastructure 
      for individuals protected by International Humanitarian Law (IHL), 
      Humanitarian ICT services should also consider the personal 
      connectivity needs of affected populations.

   2.3. Website and Online Services

      Websites and online services refer to digital platforms providing
      information, coordination tools, and communication channels for
      humanitarian activities. These may include centralized platforms
      for resource allocation, real-time collaboration, and information
      dissemination.
      Websites and online services relevant to humanitarian efforts 
      include platforms facilitating communication, data sharing, 
      and coordination among aid organizations. These platforms may 
      include portals for information exchange, crisis mapping tools, 
      and collaboration platforms. Ensuring the accessibility and 
      security of these online services is crucial for effective 
      humanitarian response.

   2.4. Credentials

      Credentials are authentication and authorization mechanisms used to
      verify the identity and permissions of individuals accessing
      Humanitarian ICT services. Credential-based systems can be
      employed to distinguish and prioritize services based on the
      credentials of Humanitarian ICT workers in challenging conditions.

3. Prioritization Mechanisms
    To address potential disruptions in internet services during crises, 
    a prioritization mechanism based on credentials is proposed. 
    Humanitarian ICT workers and relevant websites and online services 
    can be issued credentials to distinguish their criticality during 
    periods of limited internet access. These credentials would aid in 
    prioritizing access, ensuring that essential services for 
    humanitarian response are maintained even in challenging 
    circumstances.

   3.1. Importance of Prioritization

      In humanitarian crises, internet services may face disruptions or
      become unavailable. It is essential to establish mechanisms for
      prioritizing Humanitarian ICT services to ensure that critical
      operations continue despite adverse conditions.

   3.2. Credential-Based Prioritization

      Credential-based prioritization involves assigning specific
      credentials to Humanitarian ICT workers based on their roles,
      expertise, and the critical nature of their tasks. During
      disruptions, services accessed using these credentials are
      prioritized, enabling essential functions to continue.

   3.3. Adaptive Algorithms

      Adaptive algorithms can be employed to dynamically adjust
      prioritization based on real-time conditions. These algorithms
      consider factors such as the severity of the crisis, the number of
      available Humanitarian ICT workers, and the criticality of
      services to optimize resource allocation.

4. Security and Privacy Considerations

   4.1. Protection of Credentials

      The security of credential-based prioritization is paramount.
      Mechanisms should be in place to protect and regularly update
      credentials to prevent unauthorized access. Multi-factor
      authentication is encouraged to enhance security.

   4.2. Data Privacy

      Humanitarian ICT services often involve sensitive information.
      Policies and technologies must be implemented to safeguard the
      privacy of data, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and
      ethical standards.

5. Considerations for Humanitarian ICT Workers

    In defining Humanitarian ICT workers, considerations for adherence 
    to ethical standards, adherence to IHL, and a commitment to the 
    principles of impartiality, neutrality, and independence are crucial. 
    Additionally, recognizing the need for skill sets that align with the 
    unique challenges of humanitarian settings is essential. This RFC 
    encourages training programs and professional development initiatives 
    tailored to the specific requirements of Humanitarian ICT workers.

6.  Security and Privacy Considerations

    Given the sensitive nature of information processed in Humanitarian ICT 
    services, robust security and privacy measures must be implemented. 
    This includes encryption standards, secure data storage, and secure 
    communication channels. Credential issuance and management should adhere 
    to strict security protocols to prevent misuse. Ensuring compliance with 
    data protection laws and international standards for the handling of 
    sensitive information is paramount.
