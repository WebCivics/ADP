# ADP
Agent Discovery Protocol

## Description

This document specifies the Agent Discovery Protocol (ADP), a mechanism for describing agents, their associated Web of Data services, and relevant metadata at a given URL. ADP builds upon existing web standards and leverages RDF for rich, machine-readable descriptions but caters specifically to the decentralized and data-ownership-centric nature of emerging internet technologies and protocols.  The protocol supports agent identification, capability descriptions, service endpoints, access control information, and various classifications.  
To enhance trust and verifiability, ADP accommodates the inclusion of Verifiable Credentials and supports DNS-based verification methods.


## Background

Few Background Notes.  There are some complex underlying considerations, associated to the notion of ADP.  

### Semantic Web

‘Web Science, AI and the Future of the Internet’ at #WWSSS19 ["Semantic Web / Knowledge Graph is inherantly AI"](https://twitter.com/DameWendyDBE/status/1172470883610431489)

Many are not aware of of the status and use of 'semantic web' or related 'web of data' bodies of work, primarily produced in the form of web-standardisation efforts via W3C, although not exclusively. Semantic Web is a high-level term that represents a broad ecosystem of components. One of the earlier presentations about the underlying notions is from WWW94 (1994) [TimBL Snippet 1994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkjyCPuTKPw), however 'semantic web' was more formerally launched some years later via the paper [The Semantic Web "by TIM BERNERS-LEE, JAMES HENDLER and ORA LASSILA"](https://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/cours/essi2006/Scientific%20American_%20Feature%20Article_%20The%20Semantic%20Web_%20May%202001.pdf).  

Some of the earliest work was produced via DARPA, see [DAML+Oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Agent_Markup_Language) and the [Web of Data](https://www.w3.org/2013/data/) has since developed substantially. The [Open Linked Data Cloud](https://lod-cloud.net/) provides some insights about it.  

Semantic web involves many 'loosly coupled' components.  There are query languages, rules and logical programming languages and more recently also, supports for credentials, personal data-storage; where, [Solid](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/) and [cognative ai](https://www.w3.org/community/cogai/) works are underway.
