# ADP
Agent Discovery Protocol

## Description

This document specifies the Agent Discovery Protocol (ADP), a mechanism for describing agents, their associated Web of Data services, and relevant metadata at a given URL. ADP builds upon existing web standards and leverages RDF for rich, machine-readable descriptions but caters specifically to the decentralized and data-ownership-centric nature of emerging internet technologies and protocols.  The protocol supports agent identification, capability descriptions, service endpoints, access control information, and various classifications.  
To enhance trust and verifiability, ADP accommodates the inclusion of Verifiable Credentials and supports DNS-based verification methods.
