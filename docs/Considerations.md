# Considerations

## Encryption / Verification Method 

Somehow the file needs to be securely received with confidence.

This could have multiple 'modes', that support different implementation methods with related caviets and relaed considerations that can be noted and in-turn also, that recommendations about how / what could/should or should not be used with those methods, also defined.

## Versions

### Simple Version

Create a version that doesn't care about encryption or security; just defines the file & works.

###  DNS method

Figure out the DNS method

### TLS Method

Figure out the TLS Method

### PGP method

How could a PGP method be defined? Can PGP be used?  if so, what's the implementation method and implications.

Question then becomes also scripting support, perhaps via PHP, but this then elevates the requirements; and the implications from the POV of the client, is still somewhat unresolved.

## Web Of Trust

This is in-effect a relatively simple example of a problem that requires some form of 'web of trust' solution.  

## Demo of Social Web Extension also considered helpful

Need to add the web-extension method into the repo.

- Web Extension should be appended to support the ADP method.

## Registrations and ID (internet Draft) Dev

- Use XML (not txt)
- Follow-up on IANA Reqs to register ADP
- Better identify method / process, for registering OIDs, and then associate that with the process

- Note Whois infomation linkages. (ask DNS folk about it)
