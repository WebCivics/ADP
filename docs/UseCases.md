1.  Verifying Essential Services: VCs issued by bodies like the UN could unambiguously identify humanitarian aid organizations or critical infrastructure providers, ensuring discoverability and facilitating appropriate treatment of their services.  
      
    
2.  Reliable Age-Appropriate Content: Government-issued VCs could attest to age-related content ratings, providing a robust mechanism for content providers to declare classifications and for users or parental control systems to enforce restrictions.  
      
    
3.  Control over Personal Data Storage: VCs can empower individuals with verifiable attestations about the nature of personal data storage services, their compliance with regulations, or specific access control policies.  
      
    
4.  Combating Website Impersonation: VCs tied to domain ownership and issued by regulatory bodies can help distinguish legitimate websites (banks, government services) from fraudulent impersonators.  
      
    

In Summary, the inclusion of Verifiable Credentials within the Agent Discovery Protocol unlocks a powerful layer of trust, transparency, and control for agents operating within the Web 3.0, Solid, and MyData ecosystems.

### Defining services that exist within a domain structure.

if TLS is used, then TLS Certificates can be issued to different subdomains.  This is not the case for sub-directories.

For example;

/root
    /myapp
    /myotherapp
    /mychatbot

therefore, 

The ADP method could define information about multiple agents, by providing a check-sum reference for the files contained within the sub-directories
