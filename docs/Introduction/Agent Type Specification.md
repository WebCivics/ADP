1.  Agent Type Refinement:
    

-   Vocabulary: We'll likely need terms from relevant ontologies to differentiate between human agents and various software agents. We might propose an extension if nothing suitable exists.
    
-   Field Update: Adjust the mandatory "Agent Type" field to accommodate these distinctions.  
      
    

3.  AI-Specific Properties:
    

-   Capabilities: Define optional fields to describe the AI agent's capabilities (e.g., natural language processing, image recognition, etc.).
    
-   Model Information: Potentially include fields to link to model descriptions or metadata.
    
-   Input/Output: Fields to describe the expected input data types and the format of the output the AI agent produces.
    

Ethics Statement (Optional): A field to link to an ethics statement or guidelines governing the AI agent's use.  
  

-   Vocabularies
    

-   Explore existing relevant vocabularies (FOAF, schema.org, etc.).
    
-   Determine if extensions are needed for Solid/MyData-specific concepts.  
      
    

-   Mandatory Fields:
    

-   Agent identification (WebID, URI, etc.)
    
-   Agent type (person, organization, service, etc.)
