5. Privacy Considerations

The Agent Discovery Protocol (ADP), by design, involves making some information about agents and their services publicly discoverable.Â  It's crucial for both ADP creators and consumers to be mindful of privacy risks and best practices.

Information Exposure

-   Intended Discoverability: The core purpose of ADP is to facilitate discovery. However, implementers MUST carefully consider the trade-off between discoverability and the potential exposure of information that the agent owner might wish to keep private.
    
-   Minimize Personal Data: Where possible, personally identifiable information (PII) SHOULD be avoided within the ADP file. If PII is strictly necessary, it SHOULD be handled in accordance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) and user consent mechanisms.
    
-   Data Referencing: For sensitive data associated with an agent, it is generally RECOMMENDED to store that data in a protected location and only reference it indirectly from the ADP file.
    

  

Data Aggregation and Tracking

-   Profiling Risk: While a single ADP file might contain limited information, aggregators could potentially combine metadata from multiple ADP files to build profiles of agents or track behavior across services.
    
-   Mitigation: Agents SHOULD assess the risk of unwanted profiling and may consider techniques like pseudonymization or purposeful limitation of certain metadata to reduce this risk.
    

  

Selective Disclosure

-   Best Practice: Where ADP supports advanced mechanisms like Verifiable Credentials, agents are strongly RECOMMENDED to leverage selective disclosure. This allows agents to reveal only the necessary attributes for a specific interaction, minimizing the exposure of data.
    

  

User Awareness

-   Transparency: Applications interacting with ADP files SHOULD strive to be transparent with end-users about the collection and use of agent metadata.
    
-   Control: Where feasible, provide users with control mechanisms to manage what information is included in their associated ADP files.
    

  

Evolving Landscape

Privacy regulations and best practices are continuously evolving. Implementers SHOULD remain informed and adapt their use of ADP in line with these changes.

Important: The privacy considerations outlined in this document are not exhaustive. Applications leveraging ADP may require a more detailed privacy impact assessment to address the specific sensitivities of their use cases.
