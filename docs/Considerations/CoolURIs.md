"Cool URIs Do not Change"

The notion of CoolURIs is now fairly old, however the objective sought to be achieved many years ago, has not yet come about.   The problem becomes, that HTTP(s) resources are often lost or linked to new and/or different content, that is not the same as a reference provided by a link, at the time the link / reference was made.

This is particularly destructive to decentralised systems, including but not limited to those based upon the use of semantic web and linked-data technologies.

The ADP solution seeks address this solution, by providing a light-weight 'pointer' that can then be used to discover links, that may in-turn be defined using methods that declare the specific version of content that a client seeks to address, but may in-turn end-up having its location changed.
