4. Security Considerations

The Agent Discovery Protocol (ADP) aims to facilitate the discoverability of agents and their services, making security a paramount concern. Implementers of ADP and any applications that rely on the metadata within ADP files MUST carefully consider the following aspects:

  

Sensitive Information

-   Minimization: ADP files should contain the minimum necessary metadata to fulfill their discovery purpose. Highly sensitive information (e.g., private keys, detailed personal data) SHOULD NOT be included directly within the ADP file.
    
-   Access Control: If sensitive information must be associated with an agent, it is RECOMMENDED to store it in a secure location and reference it indirectly from the ADP file using appropriate access control mechanisms.
    

  

Verification

-   Method Choice: Implementers MUST consider the trust model and security requirements of their applications when selecting verification methods (DNS-based, Verifiable Credentials, or others). The choice of method involves trade-offs in terms of complexity, dependency on external authorities, and potential attack vectors.
    
-   Trust Anchors: For the verification to be effective, there must be clearly established trust anchors. In the case of DNS-based methods, this implies robust DNSSEC deployment. In the case of Verifiable Credentials, it necessitates mechanisms for determining trustworthy issuers.
    

  

Data Integrity

-   Tampering: Implementations SHOULD take precautions against unauthorized modification of ADP files. This could involve mechanisms for signing or regularly verifying the content of the file.
    
-   Source Validation: Applications parsing ADP files MUST validate the source to ensure they are retrieving the genuine file from the intended domain.
    

  

Privacy Implications

-   Public Exposure: The ADP file is intended to be publicly accessible. Any information included within has the potential to be indexed or used by third parties.
    
-   Selective Disclosure: Where supported (e.g., with Verifiable Credentials), agents SHOULD leverage selective disclosure techniques to reveal only the information necessary for a given interaction.
    

  

Denial of Service

-   File Size: Implementations SHOULD place reasonable limits on the size of ADP files to prevent potential denial-of-service attacks through overly complex or large files. .
    

  

Evolving Threats

The security landscape is constantly changing. Implementers are advised to stay informed about emerging threats and vulnerabilities that might affect systems interacting with ADP.  The ADP specification itself may be revised to include updated security recommendations or mitigations.

  

Important:  This section provides a high-level overview of security considerations.  Specific applications leveraging ADP may warrant additional in-depth security analysis tailored to their use cases.
