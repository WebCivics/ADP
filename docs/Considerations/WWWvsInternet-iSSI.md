# WWWvsInternet: Introducing iSSI
The world-wide-web is a series of applications that operates over Internet Protocol. The World Wide Web is not Internet.

Here's a breakdown of the difference between the World Wide Web and the Internet:

**The Internet**

-   **The Foundation:** The internet is the vast, global network of interconnected computers and devices. It's the physical infrastructure that allows information to travel around the world.
-   **Communication Protocols:** It operates using protocols like TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) which dictate how data is sent and received in packets across the network.
-   **Breadth of Services:** The internet supports numerous services, including:
    -   Email
    -   File transfer (FTP)
    -   Instant messaging
    -   Voice over IP (VoIP)
    -   And, of course, the World Wide Web

**The World Wide Web (WWW)**

-   **An Application on the Internet:** The World Wide Web is a massive collection of information and resources that are accessed _through_ the internet.
-   **Hypertext and Browsers:** It's built on the concept of hypertext (documents linked together) and visualized through web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
-   **HTTP:** The Web uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to transmit web pages, images, and other web content.
-   **Web Addresses:** You access web resources using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) that begin with http:// or https://

**Analogy:**

Think of it like this:

-   **Internet:** The highway system (roads, bridges, tunnels)
-   **World Wide Web:** The cars and trucks traveling on the highway, carrying goods (web pages, videos, etc.)

**In short:** The internet is the hardware and plumbing, while the World Wide Web is the content and services you access using that infrastructure.

Web Of Data
The Web of Data notion has developed from semantic web considerations shown to have been made by Tim Berners-lee from at least 1994.   The Web Of Data has been developed as a series of 'Web Standards' primarily led by W3C.  Arguably the invention of the Web Of Data is distinct from the invention of the World-Wide-Web, although this is a contentious issue.

The term 'Web Of Data' MAY also over simplify some of the core concepts associated with its characteristics.   

the Web Of Data;
1. MAY be supported via protocols other than HTTP and HTTPS, as such, is not simply a capacity that is strictly bonded to WWW Services.
2. IS provided through the use of Structured Data, primarily Documents structured using an RDF Serialisation Method  (todo - add 'streaming' formats: ie: https://www.w3.org/community/rsp/wiki/RDF_Stream_Models )

Web3 vs. Web 3.0
Emergent Decentralised Ledger Technologies (DLTs) delivered over Internet, including various kinds of Blockchain and DHT have grown significantly over the past decade, although this family of technologies is in-fact quite old.  

Through the emergence and promption of particular Blockchain technologies, the term web3 emerged, and has now led to many publications from leading organisations to describe blockchain related technologies as both web3 and Web 3.0. 

Whilst the historical meaning of Web 3.0 related to the advancement of the World-Wide-Web as to better support the requirements for both the Web of Data and in-turn the 'social web', these distinctions are now less clear and/or interpreted in a misleading manner considered undesirable.

It appears improbable that the term 'Web 3.0' can ever be made to regain its historical meaning.

However, this is then in-turn complicated by the implications associated with the use of tooling intended to support Web 3.0 that may in-turn also be used on protocols not considered WWW.

**Key Points:**

-   **Web of Data:** A concept of a more structured, machine-readable web built upon the foundation laid by the Semantic Web (and early vision of Web 3.0). It's more about data representation and less strictly tied to the World Wide Web.
-   **Social Web:** The people-focused aspect of the internet, where social features, interaction, and user-generated content are central.
-   **Web3 Confusion:** Current use of the term "Web3" has become tied to decentralized technologies like blockchain, muddying the waters of its original meaning.

**The Need for Clarity**

There's a need for a distinctive term that encompasses this convergence of evolving web concepts. It's also important to separate this from the hype-driven use of "Web3".

### **Future Internet**

There are various calls to redefine the internet. These efforts are associated with various names, including 'Human Centric Internet', 'People Centered Internet', 'Next Generation Internet' and 'Sustainable Intelligent Internet'.   Each of these efforts and related communities, have similarities and differences; however the vision of what may be defined as 'next generation internet' irraspective of the term, is yet to be better defined.  

Part of the challenge is thought to be about the underlying need to forge improved stepping stones that act to support progress in this area, as to better define a future internet.

#### **Critical Requirement to support Humanitarian Requirements**

Humanitarian Requirements is considered to include but not be exclusive to, considerations made by International Humanitarian Law and United Nations Human Rights Instruments.

Whilst efforts are underway to better define a future internet, there are various requirements that were envisaged some time ago, sometimes decades ago, and is now considered critical.  Whilst the best developed components have been produced through traditional IETF and W3C related activities, there is a level of convergence that requires adaption of works produced via various parties, as to create the solutions required to address meaningfully, stepping stones, for Digital Transformation requirements associated to ensuring supports for Humanitarian Requirements.

### Intelligent Semantic Social Internet

The Intelligent Semantic Social Internet envisions a future iteration of the internet where:

- **Structured Knowledge:** Information is represented in machine-understandable formats (such as RDF, OWL, and other Semantic Web standards), enabling intelligent software agents  to process and reason over data (AI Software).
- **Enhanced Search and Discovery:** Search engines and applications can leverage this structured knowledge to provide more accurate, relevant, and context-aware results. This surpasses traditional keyword-based searching.
- **Social Networks as Knowledge Graphs:** Social connections, interactions, and user-generated content are woven into a rich network of interlinked data. This allows for decentralisation, human centric services providing permissive controls, and improved foundations for Human Centric AI. 
- **Human Centric Internet Supports:** The Intelligent Semantic Social Internet provides architectures, required to give users agency and greater control over their data and interactions.
- **Acts as a foundation for Human Centric AI**: Intelligent Semantic Social Internet is intended to provide the plumbing required to support future Human Centric, Personal Artificial Intelligence Agents.
- **Building Block for Human Centric Internet**: The Intelligent Semantic Social Internet concept is considered to be a stepping stone towards a more fulsome 'Human Centric' or 'People Centered' internet.
- **SafeGuards for AI**: A key consideration for iSSI works, seeks to consider the need to define safety protocols and safeguards, to protect human rights and support the best interests of our biosphere and sociosphere, in this emergent age of advanced information technologies.

**Key Distinctions:**

The Intelligent Semantic Social Internet distinguishes itself from:

-   **Traditional World Wide Web:** It goes beyond hypertext documents to embrace highly structured, interlinked data for both machines and humans.
-   **"Web3":** It avoids the hype and ambiguity of "Web3," instead focusing on clear technological advancements and user benefits.
- **"Self Sovereign Identity"**: it seeks to avoid designs that seek to define natural agents by a wallet software service.

**Key Opportunities:**

The opportunity to define tooling for an Intelligent Semantic Social Internet provides an opportunity to reconsider the relationships between different inter-dependent elements of internet and web-of-data technologies, as to produce an advanced modern 'fit for purpose' ecosystem, for future Internet. 

**Issues:**

The Semantic Social Internet acronym might become 'SSI" which is considered undesirable (ie: like another 'Web 3.0' vs. 'web3' battle / issue...), as such iSSI seeks to provide means to distinguish.
