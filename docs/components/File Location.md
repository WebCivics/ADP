File Location

-   Standard Placement: The ADP file MUST reside within the .well-known directory at the domain's root associated with the agent it describes (e.g., https://example.com/.well-known/adp). This aligns with established conventions for metadata discovery [RFC 8615].
    

File Naming: The file MUST be named adp with an appropriate extension indicating the serialization format (.ttl, .jsonld).
