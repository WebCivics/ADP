 **Verification Mechanisms

-   General Principle: State that ADP's design allows for multiple, potentially co-existing verification methods to accommodate various trust models and scenarios.
    
-   Security Section Link: Add a forward reference to the Security Considerations section, stating that implementers should thoroughly analyze the trade-offs of different verification methods. 

How Verification Would Work

1.  An agent or service discovers the ADP file.
    
2.  It parses the adp:verification property.
    
3.  It queries the DNS TXT record specified.
    
4.  It retrieves the RDF snippet from the DNS record.
    
5.  Depending on the adp:verificationType, it performs the appropriate verification. This could involve:
    

-   Signature Check: Verifying a digital signature using the public key found at <https://example.com/profile#me>.
    
-   Hash Comparison: Calculating a hash of a certain resource and comparing it with a hash value in the DNS record.
    

RFC Considerations

-   Standardization of Properties: Clearly define adp:verification, adp:dnsRecord, adp:verificationType, etc.
    
-   Signature Schemes: Recommend supported signature schemes for use with ADP.
    
-   Alternative Methods: We might explore other DNS-based verification methods if suitable (e.g., DANE).
    

Advantages

-   Control: Domain owners retain control over verification.
    
-   No Central Authority: Decentralized, doesn't require a single trusted entity.
    
-   Flexibility: Can support different verification mechanisms.
    

Proposed Mechanism

1.  Embedding ADP: Upon generating or renewing a TLS certificate for a domain, the ADP file's content (either in full or a representation) would be embedded into the subjectAltName field of the certificate. This is the same method used for WebID-TLS.  
    
2.  Hash in DNS: A cryptographic hash of the ADP file would be placed in a DNS TXT record on the domain.
    
3.  Verification Workflow:
    

-   Client/Agent: Discovers the ADP verification reference during the TLS handshake when it examines the server's certificate.
    
-   Verification: It calculates a hash of the extracted ADP data and compares it with the hash retrieved via a DNS TXT lookup.
    

Potential Advantages

-   Tight Coupling: Strong binding between the TLS session and the ADP metadata, ensuring authenticity during secure communication.
    
-   Hash Efficiency: Verification relies on comparing hashes, which can be computationally efficient.
    
-   DNS as a Trust Anchor: Leverages DNS as a control point for the domain owner.
    

Considerations

-   Certificate Extension: We'd likely need to define a standardized certificate extension for carrying ADP data. (This might require broader IETF involvement.)
    
-   Certificate Size: Investigate if embedding ADP significantly impacts certificate sizes and if there are any performance concerns.
    
-   Hash Algorithm: The RFC should specify the recommended secure hash algorithm.
    
-   Revocation: Address how certificate revocation and updates would affect ADP files and their associated hashes in DNS.
    
-   Adoption: Requires modifications to tooling that handles TLS certificates and DNS record management.
    

Benefits of Verifiable Credentials in ADP

The integration of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) into the Agent Discovery Protocol (ADP) offers several significant advantages:

-   Enhanced Trust and Verification: VCs provide a cryptographically secure and tamper-proof mechanism for agents to present claims about their identity, affiliations, permissions, or other attributes. This enables relying parties to make informed decisions based on trustworthy assertions issued by recognized authorities.    
    
-   Decentralized Identity and Attestation: VCs support a decentralized trust model, reducing reliance on single points of failure or centralized identity providers. Agents have greater control over the disclosure of their information.    
    
-   Standardization and Interoperability: By adhering to the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model, ADP ensures that claims and credentials are represented in a well-defined, machine-readable format. This fosters interoperability across different systems and platforms.  
    
-   Privacy-Preserving: VCs, along with selective disclosure techniques, allow agents to reveal only the necessary information for a given interaction. This minimizes the sharing of potentially sensitive data and enhances user privacy.  
    
Flexibility: The VC model can accommodate a wide range of use cases. Ontologies can be developed or extended to support the specific needs of essential services, content classification, personal data storage, website verification, and other domains relevant to ADP.
