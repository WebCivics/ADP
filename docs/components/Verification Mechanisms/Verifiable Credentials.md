Verifiable Credentials

-   Integration Point: Define how Verifiable Credentials (VCs) can be embedded within or referenced from the ADP file.
    
-   Syntax Considerations: Consider if specific JSON-LD structures are needed to harmonize VC representation in ADP.
    
-   Issuer Trust: Briefly address the importance of establishing trust anchors for VC issuers, potentially referencing external specifications or community-maintained registries.
