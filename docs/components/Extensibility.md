Extensibility

-   Ontologies: ADP is designed to leverage existing ontologies (e.g., Schema.org, FOAF) and accommodate the development of domain-specific ontologies as needed.
    
-   RDF's Power: Emphasize that the choice of RDF as ADP's foundation inherently provides a level of extensibility through the use of well-defined ontologies.
    
-   Vocabulary Recommendations: Discuss existing ontologies that might be immediately suitable for ADP (e.g., FOAF, Schema.org, Dublin Core). Outline a process for recommending or endorsing ontologies for specific domains.
    
-   ADP Namespace: Introduce a dedicated ADP namespace (adp:) for core properties. Describe how it will be defined and governed.
    
-   Community Involvement: Underscore the potential for community participation in extending ADP through vocabulary development. Mention potential forums or working groups where such collaboration could occur.
