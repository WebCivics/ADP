# Personal Data Storage Ontology

StorageService: The overarching class for a data storage service.
StorageProvider: Represents the company or organization providing the service.
ServiceVersion: Indicates the specific version of the storage service.
Functionality: Describes what a service can do (e.g., file storage, data sharing).
TermsOfService: A link to the terms of service document.
AuthorizationGateway: The main component.
AccessPolicy: Represents an individual policy rule.
ConsentRecord: Tracks user consent decisions.

Absolutely! Let's describe an authorization gateway for a Personal Data Storage (PDS) service in the context of social web protocols.

**Core Functions of the Authorization Gateway**

1. **Authentication & Identity Management:**
   *  **User Verification:** Ensures the user is who they claim to be.  Potential methods include traditional logins, but also more decentralized approaches like WebID (using WebIDs and authentication with certificates).
   * **Identity Mapping:** The gateway should map social web identities (e.g., WebIDs, ActivityPub actor profiles) to the internal identity representation of the PDS.

2. **Fine-Grained Access Control:**
   * **Policy Specification:** Support standards like Web Access Control (WAC), OAuth, or potentially specialized ontologies to define who or what can access specific data resources within the PDS. These policies could encompass users, applications, and social circles.
   * **Policy Enforcement:** The gateway intercepts requests to PDS resources and determines, based on the defined policies, whether access should be granted. 

3. **Delegation and Consent:**
   * **Request Evaluation:** The gateway presents the user with clear, privacy-aware explanations of data access requests from applications or other users on the social web.
   * **Consent Management:** Provides the user with tools to grant, revoke, and modify permissions related to their stored data, potentially including granular choices about what aspects of data can be accessed and for how long.

4.  **Auditing and Logging:**
    * **Transparency:**  The gateway should maintain logs of access decisions, consent modifications, and other relevant actions for the user to review. 

**Social Web Protocol Integration**

* **ActivityPub:** The gateway could support ActivityPub's `Authorize` activity to handle access requests and negotiate authentication/authorization with external apps and social actors.
* **Web Access Control (WAC):** WAC's policy model could be used to define access control rules within the PDS itself and how they apply to social web interactions.
* **Linked Data Platform (LDP):**  If the PDS has an LDP interface, the gateway can intercept and manage access at the LDP resource level.

**Example Scenario**

1. A user's friend on a compatible social network wants to view a photo album stored in the user's PDS.
2. The friend's social app sends a request conforming to ActivityPub protocols.
3. The authorization gateway intercepts the request, authenticates the friend, and checks the PDS's policies.
4. If the user has previously granted the friend access to these photos, or if a policy allows for this type of sharing, the gateway allows the request to proceed.
5. If not, the gateway prompts the user for an explicit consent decision.

**Important Considerations**

* **Usability:**  Balancing security with a seamless user experience is key for social interactions.  
* **Interoperability:** Adherence to protocols like ActivityPub is crucial for communication with diverse social web applications.
* **Privacy:**  Make privacy the foundation of design.  Provide clear choices and transparency to users about their data and permissions.
