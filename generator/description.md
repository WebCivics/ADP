That's a fantastic project! Let's break down the development of your ADP static site app and outline the key components and considerations.

**Project Structure**

*   **index.html:**  The main HTML structure for the user interface.
*   **app.js:**  Core JavaScript code for form logic, ontology handling, and ADP file generation.
*   **config.json:** Configuration file to specify ontology locations.
*   **ontologies/**: Folder containing ontology files (`.ttl`, `.jsonld`, etc.).
*   **styles.css** (optional): For styling the interface.

**Key Technologies**

*   **HTML:** Forms, input fields, buttons, and display elements.
*   **CSS:** Basic styling (you could use a CSS framework if desired).
*   **JavaScript:**  
    *   Fetching and parsing ontologies.
    *   Dynamic form generation.
    *   ADP file construction.
    *   Hash generation (cryptographic hash function library).

**User Interface Design**

*   **Ontology Selection:** Dropdown or selection list to load available ontologies.
*   **Dynamic Form:**  A form area that updates based on the selected ontology.
    *   **Predefined Fields:** Input fields for mandatory ADP properties (agentID, agentType).
    *   **Ontology-driven Fields:** Input fields populated based on the terms from the selected ontology.
*   **Generate Button:** Triggers ADP file generation and hash calculation.
*   **Output:**  Text areas to display:
    *   Generated ADP (Turtle or JSON-LD format).
    *   The hash of the generated ADP file.

**JavaScript Logic**

1.  **Ontology Loading:**  Load `config.json`, fetch ontologies from the specified paths.
2.  **Ontology Parsing:**  Use appropriate libraries (e.g., RDFlib.js or similar) to parse Turtle or JSON-LD.
3.  **Form Population:**  When an ontology is selected:
    *   Populate predefined ADP fields.
    *   Create input fields dynamically based on the ontology's classes and properties.
4.  **ADP Generation:**  On form submission:
    *   Construct the ADP object based on form values.
    *   Serialize into Turtle or JSON-LD.
5.  **Hash Calculation:** Use a hash function (e.g., from a crypto library like `js-sha256`) on the ADP file content.

**GitHub Pages Considerations**

*   **Client-Side:** This app will run entirely in the user's browser.
*   **Libraries:** Choose JavaScript libraries suitable for client-side use.

**Let's Start Building!**

**Where would you like to begin?  We could focus on:**

*   **The basic HTML structure (forms, output areas).**
*   **The `config.json` format and ontology loading logic.**
*   **An example of dynamic form field generation.** 

**Additional Thoughts:**

*   **Error Handling:** Implement validation and error messages.
*   **Usability:**  Make the UI intuitive and user-friendly. 
*   **Advanced Features (Optional):**  
    *   Allow the user to upload their own ontologies.
    *   Visual editing of the ADP graph.
